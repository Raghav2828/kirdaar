					<p>During your engagement shoot or portrait session I will assist and direct you through posing and expression to get you and your fiancée / partner comfortable in front of the camera so we can incorporate both posed and natural moments on your special day. </p>

					<p>I love trying creative things in a fast paced environment. I adapt to any given situation and try to bring the beauty out that is already there. This is your day, lets have fun with it and make memories.</p>
					<p>I have won a boatload of awards for my work, and I’m grateful for every single one of them, but I’ve always been unsure of whether I earned them or whether the jury was rigged.  By now I am literally addicted to making photos…for which there is no known cure, except to make more.</p>
